Creating DCC analysis summary file after submission has taken place
Additional details in README.batch.md

1. Created new branch to hold commits associated with submission:
    git checkout -b submission
    git add analyses.dat batch.dat
    git commit
2. check out origin master
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
3. bring back edits from Y2.all
    git checkout submission -- analyses.dat batch.dat
    git add analyses.dat batch.dat
    git commit

4. Test post-staging analysis summary creation:
        bash 3_update_DCC_summary.sh -1d
    Good to do an inspection of the STAGE_ROOT directory and make sure all data is there
    It might helpful for safety reasons to make STAGE_ROOT read-only
        chmod a-w -R $STAGE_ROOT

5. run whole shebang:
    bash 3_update_DCC_summary.sh
   This generates dat/PIPELINE.DCC_analysis_summary.dat
