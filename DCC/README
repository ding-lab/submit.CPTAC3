Uploading and downloading of data to CPTAC DCC.

Brief summary of past work:
  * submit.CPTAC3.b1.C - this project.  Using python, get "Server not responding." error
    - see README.networking-debug for details
  * submit.cptac3.b1.B - previous project.  Successfully used Python version of cptactransfer
    - /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CPTAC3/submit/submit.CPTAC3.b1.B
  * /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CPTAC3/DCC - prior work on MGI.  Was not able to get binary executable to work.
    - Got help from MGI, issue ITSD-2310
    - cptactransfer error: "Server not responding." 
  * DC2: /home/mwyczalk_test/src/aspera/download - status unclear
  * Epazote b1.A submission: /Users/mwyczalk/Data/CPTAC3/submit.CPTAC3.b1.A/DCC
    - successfully use python version of cptactransfer
    - `cptactransfer.py` continues to work while submit.CPTAC3.b1.C at MGI does not

DCC has private and restricted areas.  Scripts in package above for accessing both:
    cptacdcc (for transferring from private portal) 
    cptactransfer (for transferring from restricted area).

Installation:
    Downloaded to ~/src from :
        http://edwardslab.bmcb.georgetown.edu/software/downloads/CPTAC-DCC/cptacdcc-1.6.20.src.tgz
    to /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CPTAC3/DCC/cptacdcc-1.6.20

    Files cptacdcc.ini and cptactransfer.ini are copied from MGI, modified so that Install = /gscuser/mwyczalk/.aspera/cli

Testing:
    * Rework this to be more generic, simple.
    * simply running cptactransfer should give back directory listing

    Test examples for cptacdcc:
        Downloading SummaryReports.08272017 from
            https://cptacdcc.georgetown.edu/cptac/dataPrivate/list/4_CPTAC2_Ovarian_Prospective_Collection_PNNL?currentPath=/cptac_shared

        Using cptacdcc for this private data

        To view directory
            cptacdcc cptac_shared/4_CPTAC2_Ovarian_Prospective_Collection_PNNL/SummaryReports.08272017/
        To download
            cptacdcc get cptac_shared/4_CPTAC2_Ovarian_Prospective_Collection_PNNL/SummaryReports.08272017/

    Similar approach will work for restriced.  This is implemented in test_dcc_restricted.sh
