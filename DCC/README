Uploading and downloading of data to CPTAC DCC.

Based on work here: 
  * DC2 (earlier work) /home/mwyczalk_test/src/aspera/download
  * MGI (later work) /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CPTAC3/DCC

DCC has private and restricted areas.  Scripts in package above for accessing both:
    cptacdcc (for transferring from private portal) 
    cptactransfer (for transferring from restricted area).

Installation:
    Downloaded to ~/src from :
        http://edwardslab.bmcb.georgetown.edu/software/downloads/CPTAC-DCC/cptacdcc-1.6.20.src.tgz
    Note that for OS X usage, using python version of the client

    Downloaded and installed 
        http://download.asperasoft.com/download/sw/cli/3.7.6/aspera-cli-3.7.6.636.4d51a47-mac-10.7-64-release.sh

    Added the following to ~/.bashrc_profile
        export PATH="/Users/mwyczalk/Applications/Aspera\ CLI/bin:/Users/mwyczalk/src/cptacdcc:$PATH"

    Files cptacdcc.ini and cptactransfer.ini are copied from MGI, modified so that Install = /Users/mwyczalk/Applications/Aspera CLI/bin

Testing:

    Test examples for cptacdcc:
        Downloading SummaryReports.08272017 from
            https://cptacdcc.georgetown.edu/cptac/dataPrivate/list/4_CPTAC2_Ovarian_Prospective_Collection_PNNL?currentPath=/cptac_shared

        Using cptacdcc for this private data

        To view directory
            cptacdcc cptac_shared/4_CPTAC2_Ovarian_Prospective_Collection_PNNL/SummaryReports.08272017/
        To download
            cptacdcc get cptac_shared/4_CPTAC2_Ovarian_Prospective_Collection_PNNL/SummaryReports.08272017/

    Similar approach will work for restriced.  This is implemented in test_dcc_restricted.sh
