# Uploading and downloading of data to CPTAC DCC.

## Brief summary of past work:

  * submit.CPTAC3.b1.C - this project.  Moving from cptacdcc scripts to aspera ascp client
    - see README.networking-debug for details
  * submit.cptac3.b1.B - previous project.  Successfully used Python version of cptactransfer
    - /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CPTAC3/submit/submit.CPTAC3.b1.B
  * /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CPTAC3/DCC - prior work on MGI.  Was not able to get binary executable to work.
    - Got help from MGI, issue ITSD-2310
    - cptactransfer error: "Server not responding." 
  * DC2: /home/mwyczalk_test/src/aspera/download - status unclear
  * Epazote b1.A submission: /Users/mwyczalk/Data/CPTAC3/submit.CPTAC3.b1.A/DCC
    - successfully use python version of cptactransfer
    - `cptactransfer.py` continues to work while submit.CPTAC3.b1.C at MGI does not

DCC has private and restricted areas.  Focus here is transfer to restricted areas.

## Installation:
    Need to download aspera connect: http://downloads.asperasoft.com/connect2//

    copy ascp_config.ini-template to ascp_config.ini, and define the username and token values

## Tokens
Tokens no longer work.  Using password method

## Testing:

`ascp_test` copies a test data tree (`DCC-debug/test_dataset`) to root folder of DCC

# Downloading

`ascp_recv_test.sh` used for downloading data.  The trick here is that you need to obtain a token corresponding to each
data file or directory you wish to download.  The procecure to obtain the token is similar to that for the upload token,
but search instead for `data-direction="receive"` and save the token associated with the file or directory of interest
in ascp_config.ini as ASCP_TOKEN_RECEIVE
