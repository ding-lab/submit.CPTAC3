# stage data by copying source data to target.  Staging directories created
# Usage: 
#  stage_data.sh [options] analysis datadir input.suffix output.suffix pipeline_version
#
# analysis: canonical analysis name, e.g., WGS-Germline
# datadir: root directory of data 
# input.suffix: suffix of input filename.  Added to CASE to construct input data filename, like "C3L-00004.SVsomatic.vcf"
# output.suffix: suffix of output filename.  Added to CASE to construct output filename.  Need not be the same as input.suffix
# pipeline_version: a text identifier of this pipeline, used for destination path creation
#
# There are assumptions about the filename of the source data, which is determined by -T/-A flags.
# If neither -T nor -A set, assumed that one data file per case, with the data filename format CASE.suffix 
# If -T is set, assumed data filename format is CASE.X.suffix, with X either T (tumor) or N (normal)
# If -A is set, assumed data filename format is CASE.X.suffix, with X either T (tumor) or A (adjacent)
# Currently, having both -T and -A is an error.  This may be relaxed in the future
#
# Options:
# -z: compress the file while staging
# -f: force overwrite of target even if it exists
# -d: dry run.  Only pretend to copy
# -1: Stop after one case
# -T: Data as tumor/normal pair
# -A: Data as tumor/adjacent pair
# -D: Append cancer type to datadir, e.g., /data/UCEC/CASE.fn for UCEC
# -Q: Append cancer type to filename, e.g., /data/UCEC__CASE.fn for UCEC.  This is ad hoc and can be removed after file naming standardized
# -w: Warn if data file does not exist rather than quitting
# -C cases: File listing all cases of interest.  Required

# Note that CNV analysis differs significantly from germline/somatic wrapper results in that it has more than one result
# per case; specifically, tumor and normal results exist for each case.
# For now, "process_case" is tweaked so that the passed argument (CASE) is a string corresponding to the case ID for the
# wrapper results (e.g., C3L-00003), whereas for CNV analyses (-T set), CASE takes values like C3L-00003.T and C3L-00003.N (from the sample name)
# Such renaming is confusing and fragile, and in future revisions the flow should be reworked to incorporate these two cases more gracefully
